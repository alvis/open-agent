# Tailscale's launcher, run as root by the tailscaled service. It keeps the
# provider's resolvers and transport networks routed through the main table
# ahead of the tunnel, recording each rule it adds, and gives tailscaled a
# resolver file it may rewrite, then replaces itself with tailscaled.
# `--prepare` only prepares; `--restore <state directory>` undoes what a
# prepare recorded there. The resolver is replaced only while it is a regular
# file systemd-resolved does not manage; otherwise tailscaled configures
# resolved itself. It reads the daemon's directories, socket and tunnel, and
# the provider's transport networks, from environment.json, and finds ip and
# tailscaled on PATH
