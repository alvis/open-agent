# Architecture

## Goal

Explain the boundaries that protect live provider truth, native harness configuration and credential ownership.

## Requirements

- A1: Use official SDK interfaces through narrow integrations.
- A2: Preserve independent native harness configuration and plugin identity.
- A3: Report observed readiness and exact deletion outcomes.

## Constraints

The selected ACP agent is the sole public service. Optional integrations use direct credentials. Latest-stable maintenance installs in place when due and never restarts a service. No local machine registry or connector feature exists.

Architecture documents describe current structure. Effective ADRs explain accepted choices; historical decision bodies remain unchanged in the superseded archive.
